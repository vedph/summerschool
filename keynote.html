    <h4>Day 2 - Tuesday, 12 July</h4>

    <p id="bessi_fusi_campagnolo">9:30-11:15 - Session led by Benedetta Bessi (Ca’ Foscari), Daniele Fusi (University of Bamberg/Ca’ Foscari) and Alberto Campagnolo (Université Catholique de Louvain, Louvain-la-Neuve)</p>
    <p class="text-secondary color" style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Title</strong>: <em>The Sky is the Limit - A global approach to digital textual scholarship: The Coronelli’s Celestial Globe</em> </p>
    <p class="text-secondary color" style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Abstract: </strong>The Marciana National Library holds the first set of 3 ½ foot celestial and terrestrial printed globes made by Vincenzo Coronelli (1650-1718) and bequeathed to the Venetian Republic in 1689. Uncommon textual objects, the globes are a perfect example of the possibilities of a global approach to digital textual scholarship. The celestial globe, printed on laid paper gores - subsequently mounted on plaster over a wooden structure - is of particular interest as it presents unique features, including numerous manuscript insertions, that lead to its identification as a prototype.</p>


    <p id="fisher_monella_hessler_mancinelli_errico_marsili">11:30-12:45 - Session led by Franz Fischer (Ca’ Foscari), Paolo Monella (Sapienza University of Rome), Holger Hessler (Ca’ Foscari), Tiziana Mancinelli (Ca’ Foscari; Istituto Centrale per la Digitalizzazione del Patrimonio Culturale/Digital Library), Miriam Vita Errico (Ca’ Foscari) and Silvia Marsili (Ca’ Foscari)</p>
    <p class="text-secondary color" style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Title</strong>: <em>Leaving Venice - Editing a manuscript of Marco Polo’s travels</em> </p>
    <p class="text-secondary color" style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Abstract: </strong>The session will provide an overview of digital philology methods, based on the case study of manuscript Bodleian Library 264, including an illustrated copy of the travel report of the Venetian explorer Marco Polo. After a presentation of the manuscript, students will discuss which of its features should be included in a digital model. Then an actual digital edition of the manuscript will be shown and discussed. Based on the latter, the instructors will introduce: the basics of TEI XML textual markup; issues related with the intersection of the document material structure and the abstract textual structure; the TEI Guidelines; the encoding of named entities (people and places).</p>

    <p id="boschetti_delgrosso_macchiarelli_tanozzi_puliero">16:00-18:00 - Session led by Federico Boschetti (ILC-CNR; Ca’ Foscari), Angelo Mario Del Grosso (ILC-CNR; Ca’ Foscari), Agnese Macchiarelli (Ca’ Foscari), Federico Tanozzi (Ca’ Foscari) and Jessica Puliero (Ca’ Foscari)</p>
    <p class="text-secondary color" style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Title</strong>: <em>The Remains of the Text - Natural Language Processing</em> </p>
    <p class="text-secondary color" style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Abstract: </strong>The first part is devoted to a linguistic study of Italian, Latin and Greek astronomical texts both in prose and in verses. Students will learn how to perform morphosyntactic analysis by applying computational linguistics methods and instruments. The second part consists of a “hands-on” session in which students will work on the Musisque Deoque Platform for the intertextual analysis of Latin poems on astronomy and nature.</p>

    <h4>Day 3 - Wednesday, 13 July</h4>
    
    <p id="bernardini_corro_danelon_delpozzo_dolcetti_1">9:45-10:30 - Guided tour and activity led by Federico Bernardini (VeDPH/Ca’ Foscari), Elisa Corrò (VeDPH/Ca’ Foscari), Nevio Danelon (VeDPH/Ca’ Foscari), Eleonora Delpozzo (VeDPH/Ca’ Foscari) and Francesca Dolcetti (VeDPH/Ca’ Foscari)</p>
    <p class="text-secondary color" style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Title</strong>: <em>St Mark’s square</em> </p>
    <p class="text-secondary color" style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Abstract: </strong>Spolia are artifacts dating back to Antiquity and inserted in the urban fabric, as architectural elements and/or decorations. Venice is a remarkable example of this phenomenon; two places in particular are important to understand the significance of spolia as symbols of power: St. Mark’s square and the Arsenale. During the morning, the participants will be guided in discovering the “stones of Venice”, nowadays endangered for various reasons.</p>

    <p id="bernardini_corro_danelon_delpozzo_dolcetti_2">10:30-12.30 - Guided tour and activity led by Federico Bernardini (VeDPH/Ca’ Foscari), Elisa Corrò (VeDPH/Ca’ Foscari), Nevio Danelon (VeDPH/Ca’ Foscari), Eleonora Delpozzo (VeDPH/Ca’ Foscari) and Francesca Dolcetti (VeDPH/Ca’ Foscari)</p>
    <p class="text-secondary color" style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Title</strong>: <em>Arsenale</em> </p>
    <p class="text-secondary color" style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Abstract: </strong>Digital technologies can offer tools and solutions to address the issue of the endangered CH, in particular through the so-called “digital copies”. SfM offers the possibility of fast and low-cost acquisition of 3D spatial data of artifacts, buildings and landscapes, using simple overlapping pictures. After a short introduction to the basics of SfM, participants will conduct their own survey of one of the ancient marble Lions in front of the Arsenale.</p>

    <p id="bernardini_danelon_delpozzo">14:00-15:30 - Workshop led by Federico Bernardini (VeDPH/Ca’ Foscari), Nevio Danelon (VeDPH/Ca’ Foscari), and Eleonora Delpozzo (VeDPH/Ca’ Foscari)</p>
    <p class="text-secondary color" style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Title</strong>: <em>Digital Technologies - From image acquisition to point cloud and 3D models</em> </p>
    <p class="text-secondary color" style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Abstract: </strong>During this workshop, participants will learn how to process the images acquired during the morning using the SfM Agisoft Metashape software, in order to produce 3D models of the spolia.</p>

    <p id="corro_dolcetti">15:45-18:00 - Workshop led by Elisa Corrò (VeDPH/Ca’ Foscari) and Francesca Dolcetti (VeDPH/Ca’ Foscari)</p>
    <p class="text-secondary color" style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Title</strong>: <em>Public engagement and cooperative learning</em> </p>
    <p class="text-secondary color" style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Abstract: </strong>This workshop will focus on the development of good practices for management and promotion of the endangered CH in Venice. Participants will be working in groups using either digital models or printed replicas of the spolia to develop four distinct media outcomes, which will be disseminated via the VeDPH communication channels:
    <ol>
        <li>Social media: post /meme for Instagram and Twitter</li>
        <li>3  minutes double interview targeting broader publics/li>
        <li>3 minutes TED talk for specialist audiences</li>
        <li>Virtual exhibition with panels using the kunstmatrix software</li>
    </ol>
    </p>

    <h4>Day 4 - Thursday, 14 July</h4>

    <p id="nevola">9:30-13:00 - Workshop led by Fabrizio Nevola (University of Exeter; Ca’ Foscari)</p>
    <p class="text-secondary color" style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Title</strong>: <em>Making the Renaissance Public: the example of Hidden Cities apps</em> </p>
    <p class="text-secondary color" style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Abstract: </strong>Drawing from two research projects, Hidden Cities (see <a href="https://www.hiddencities.eu">www.hiddencities.eu</a>) and Florence4D (<a href="https://www.florence4d.org">www.florence4d.org</a>) this class considers how digital history methods are creating new research opportunities, while at the same opening up new ways to engage the wider public. Spatially-determined research questions encourage us to think about how meaning is constructed from the triad of spaces-objects-people, while spatial technologies (GIS, GPS, 3D modeling) allow us to shape innovative responses to those questions, ranging from interactive map interfaces to locative interpretation delivered on handheld devices. In so doing we are discovering new things about the material culture of public space in the Renaissance, but also making that research directly available to the public.</p>

    <p id="frizzera">14:30-16:00 - Lecture by Francesco Frizzera (Museo Storico della Guerra, Rovereto)</p>
    <p class="text-secondary color" style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Title</strong>: <em>Museums and Public History. From collections to users-oriented Museums</em> </p>
    <p class="text-secondary color" style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Abstract: </strong> ver recent decades museums have radically transformed, adjusted and re-invented their principles, policies and practices. Traditional museum definition no longer seems to reflect the challenges, manifold visions and responsibilities of museums facing contemporary societies. Authoritative and generally accepted definitions of museum do not longer fit the role of museums in terms of public expectancy. Aim of the lesson is to show the potential and limits - conceptual, financial and contextual - of this approach through some examples and experiences of the Italian context: among them, some experiences of the mixture of Digital and Public History developed by Italian cultural institutions.</p>

    <p id="basilico">16:00-16:20 - Presentation by Anna Clara Basilicò (VeDPH/Ca’ Foscari)</p>
    <p class="text-secondary color" style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Title</strong>: <em>Displaying historical violence. The case of Inquisition and torture museums</em> </p>
    <p class="text-secondary color" style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Abstract: </strong>Exhibitions and museums on the Inquisition are usually focused on the trial procedure, which involved torture. This form of violence is typically exhibited through torture devices in recreated prisons. In Italy, such trend is well represented by torture museums, which tend to exhibit contents related to the Inquisition by providing a narrative that reproduces the power semantic of the ruling institution. Through the case study of the Steri Palace in Palermo, I will provide an example of a different curatorial choice, which leads the visitors to focus on a different perspective: a form of collective knowledge about early modern confinement rooted in the captives’ experience that modifies the positioning of the visitors.</p>

    <p id="dallaglio_karrer">16:30-18:00 - Guided tour led by Stefano Dall’Aglio (VeDPH/Ca’ Foscari) and Livio Karrer (M9)</p>
    <p class="text-secondary color" style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Title</strong>: <em>Visit to M9 Museum</em> </p>
    <p class="text-secondary color" style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Abstract: </strong>M9 belongs to a new generation of museums. For the very first time, a museum narrates the compelling history of the 20th century. A century that saw great and small changes: from evolutions in everyday life to momentous social, economic, environmental and cultural changes. State-of-the-art technologies and immersive displays help visitors learn about the past, understand the present and imagine the future.</p>

    <h4>Day 5 - Friday, 15 July</h4>

    <p id="devincentis">9:00-9:45 - Session chaired by Stefania De Vincentis (VeDPH/Ca’Foscari)</p>
    <p class="text-secondary color" style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Title</strong>: <em>A new wave of museology</em> </p>
    <p class="text-secondary color" style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Abstract: </strong>The session will focus on the digital strategy implementing the museum collection's perception for communication and research purposes. The introduction will open up to the new form of cultural object that has acquired both a physical and a digital identity thanks to the technological application. The Grimani Palace Museum will be the case study to delve deeper into this consideration. The results of the digital communication activities and the presentation of a VR360 project will be the means to reflect on a diversified and complementary access to the museum's collection.</p>
